## Task 11.1: Backend Export - CSV & JSON

```
TASK: Implement CSV and JSON export with streaming for large datasets to prevent memory issues.

SYSTEM CONTEXT: Users need to export scan data for external analysis, reporting, or backup. Streaming is critical for handling large datasets (10k+ scans) without loading everything into memory. Must support filters for targeted exports.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Dependencies: Install json2csv package for CSV generation
2. Export Module: Create ExportModule in app-backend
3. CSV Endpoint: Implement GET /export/csv:
   - Accept query parameters: startDate, endDate, barcodeType, deviceType
   - Apply filters to database query
   - Use Node.js Transform streams for streaming
   - Process records in chunks of 1000
   - Set headers: Content-Type: text/csv, Content-Disposition: attachment
   - Stream CSV rows directly to response
4. JSON Endpoint: Implement GET /export/json:
   - Same filter parameters as CSV
   - Stream JSON array using streaming JSON library
   - Process in chunks of 1000 records
   - Set headers: Content-Type: application/json, Content-Disposition: attachment
5. Streaming Implementation: Use Transform streams:
   - Create readable stream from database query
   - Transform each chunk to CSV/JSON format
   - Pipe to response stream
   - Handle backpressure correctly
6. Memory Management: Ensure constant memory usage regardless of dataset size
7. Error Handling: Handle stream errors, database errors, invalid filters
8. Authentication: Protect endpoints with JWT auth guard

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must handle 100k+ records without memory issues
- Memory usage must stay constant during export
- Fast streaming (start within 1 second)
- Proper CSV escaping for special characters
- Valid JSON array format

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Scans database from Task 3.1
- Filter logic similar to scan API (Task 5.2)
- Frontend export UI will call these endpoints (Task 11.3)

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Small datasets (<100 records) export correctly
2. Large datasets (>10,000 records) stream successfully
3. Memory usage stays constant during large exports
4. Filters apply correctly
5. CSV format valid (no broken rows)
6. JSON format valid (proper array)
7. Special characters escaped in CSV
8. Authentication required

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- ✅ CSV export endpoint functional
- ✅ JSON export endpoint functional
- ✅ Streaming handles large datasets
- ✅ Memory usage constant
- ✅ Filters working
- ✅ Proper file headers
- ✅ Error handling robust

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Follow Node.js streaming best practices
- Efficient database queries
- Proper stream error handling
- Clean, maintainable code
- Comprehensive logging

DELIVERABLES:
- ExportModule implementation
- CSV export endpoint with streaming
- JSON export endpoint with streaming

   - Apply branding colors (neon blue theme)
   - Stream PDF to response
3. Excel Endpoint: Implement GET /export/excel:
   - Accept same filter parameters
   - Create workbook with exceljs
