## Task 1.1: Backend Project Setup

```
TASK: Initialize production-ready NestJS backend with enterprise configuration, strict TypeScript, comprehensive logging, and environment validation.

SYSTEM CONTEXT: Foundation for all backend services. Must establish patterns for configuration management, logging standards, error handling, and API versioning that all future modules will follow.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Project Initialization: Create NestJS project with TypeScript strict mode
2. Directory Structure: Organize code into common/, shared/, database/, modules/ with clear separation of concerns
3. Path Aliases: Configure TypeScript paths (@/modules, @/common, @/config, @/shared) for clean imports
4. Environment Management: Create .env.example, .env.development, .env.production, .env.test with all 11 required variables (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, JWT_SECRET, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI, SENTRY_DSN, NODE_ENV, PORT, API_VERSION, LOG_LEVEL)
5. Environment Validation: Implement schema validation that fails fast on missing/invalid environment variables
6. Winston Logger: Configure structured JSON logging with timestamps, log levels (error, warn, info, debug), and environment-based configuration
7. API Versioning: Set global prefix /api/v1 for all endpoints
8. Global Interceptors: Create logging interceptor to log all requests/responses with duration
9. Global Filters: Create HTTP exception filter for consistent error responses
10. Validation Pipeline: Enable global validation with class-validator and class-transformer

CONSTRAINTS:
- TypeScript strict mode must be enabled
- No any types allowed
- All environment variables must be validated at startup
- Logger must output JSON format for production
- API must be versioned from day one

INTEGRATION POINTS:

- Future Redis module will use REDIS_URL
- All modules will use the Winston logger instance

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. App starts successfully with valid environment variables
2. App fails to start with missing environment variables
3. Logger outputs JSON format in production mode
4. All endpoints are accessible at /api/v1/*
5. HTTP exception filter returns consistent error format

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- ✅ npm run start:dev starts without errors
- ✅ Winston logger outputs structured JSON logs
- ✅ Environment validation prevents startup with missing vars
- ✅ Global prefix /api/v1 applied to all routes
- ✅ TypeScript compilation has zero errors

QUALITY STANDARDS:
