## Task 2.1: Backend CI/CD

```
TASK: Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated backend Docker builds with multi-platform support, semantic versioning, and Docker Hub publishing.

SYSTEM CONTEXT: Automates backend deployment pipeline. Every push to main triggers a production-ready Docker image build and push to Docker Hub, enabling continuous delivery.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Workflow File: Create .github/workflows/backend-build.yml
2. Trigger: Configure on push to main branch and manual workflow_dispatch
3. Docker Buildx: Set up Docker Buildx for multi-platform builds
4. Authentication: Add Docker Hub login using secrets (DOCKERHUB_USERNAME, DOCKERHUB_TOKEN)
5. Multi-Platform Build: Build for linux/amd64 platform
6. Semantic Versioning: Tag images with git commit SHA, branch name, and latest
7. Build Caching: Configure Docker layer caching for faster builds
8. Secret Documentation: Document required GitHub secrets in workflow comments
9. Build Context: Use backend directory as build context

CONSTRAINTS:
- Workflow must only trigger on backend code changes (paths filter)
- Secrets must never be exposed in logs
- Build must fail if tests fail
- Image tags must follow semantic versioning

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Docker Hub repository must exist before workflow runs
- Production deployment will pull these images

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Push to main triggers workflow
2. Docker image builds successfully
3. Image pushed to Docker Hub with correct tags
4. Build cache improves subsequent build times
5. Workflow fails on build errors

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- ✅ Workflow triggers on push to main
- ✅ Docker image published to Docker Hub
- ✅ Semantic versioning tags applied
- ✅ Build caching functional

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Follow GitHub Actions best practices
- Use official Docker actions
- Implement proper error handling


DELIVERABLES:
- .github/workflows/backend-build.yml
- Documentation of required secrets


SUCCESS METRIC: Every main branch push produces a tagged Docker image on Docker Hub.

8. Build Caching: Configure layer caching
9. Secret Documentation: Document required secrets

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must use Next.js standalone output
- Build must fail on TypeScript errors
- Environment variables must be build-time injected
- Image size must be optimized

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Connects to backend API URL

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Push to main triggers build
2. Next.js builds successfully
3. Image pushed with correct tags
4. Standalone output included
5. Build cache works

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

## Task 2.3: Mobile CI/CD

```
TASK: Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated mobile APK builds using EAS Build with GitHub Releases publishing.

SYSTEM CONTEXT: Automates mobile app builds. Tag-based releases trigger APK generation and publishing to GitHub Releases for distribution.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Workflow File: Create .github/workflows/mobile-build.yml
2. Trigger: Configure on tag push matching mobile-v* pattern
3. EAS Build: Set up Expo EAS Build
4. Authentication: Add EXPO_TOKEN secret
5. Build Profile: Use production build profile from eas.json
6. APK Generation: Build Android APK (not AAB initially)
7. GitHub Release: Upload APK to GitHub Releases
8. Release Notes: properties from release notes template
9. Secret Documentation: Document EXPO_TOKEN requirement

CONSTRAINTS:
- Only trigger on mobile version tags
- APK must be signed for production
- Build must use production environment variables
- Release must include changelog

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- EAS Build service must be configured
- GitHub Releases for distribution

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Tag push triggers workflow
2. EAS Build completes successfully
3. APK uploaded to GitHub Releases
4. Release notes generated
5. APK installable on Android devices

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- ✅ Tag push triggers build
- ✅ APK built and signed
- ✅ Release created with APK
- ✅ Changelog included

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Follow Expo EAS best practices
- Use production build configuration
- Implement proper versioning
- Test APK before release

DELIVERABLES:
- .github/workflows/mobile-build.yml
- EAS Build configuration
- Release template

SUCCESS METRIC: Tagged releases automatically produce installable APKs on GitHub Releases.
```

## Task 2.4: Admin Dashboard CI/CD

```
TASK: Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated admin dashboard Docker builds with separate versioning.

SYSTEM CONTEXT: Automates admin dashboard deployment. Builds separate from main web app with admin-specific configuration.
