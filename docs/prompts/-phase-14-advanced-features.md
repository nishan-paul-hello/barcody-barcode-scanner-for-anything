## Task 14.1: Product Comparison

```
TASK: Implement side-by-side product comparison feature for informed purchasing decisions.

SYSTEM CONTEXT: Help users compare multiple products to make informed choices about nutrition, allergens, and ingredients. Critical for health-conscious users who need to evaluate options before purchasing.

REQUIREMENTS:

BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION:

   - Nutrition facts (calories, protein, carbs, fat, sodium, sugar, fiber)
   - Allergens list
   - Ingredients list
   - Nutrition grade (A-E)
   - Category
5. Comparison Logic: Calculate differences:
   - Identify better/worse nutrition values
   - Flag common allergens
   - Highlight unique ingredients
   - Compare nutrition grades
6. Response Structure: Return comparison data with highlights and differences
7. Error Handling: Handle missing products, invalid barcodes, API failures

WEB IMPLEMENTATION:

3. Comparison View: Display side-by-side or stacked comparison:
   - Responsive layout for mobile
   - Show key differences
   - Nutrition facts comparison
6. Share Feature: Add share comparison:
   - Generate comparison image
   - Share via messaging apps
   - Save to photos

CONSTRAINTS:

## Task 14.2: Advanced Search & Filters

```

SYSTEM CONTEXT: Enable users to find scans quickly with powerful search capabilities. Critical for users with large scan histories who need to locate specific items efficiently.

REQUIREMENTS:

BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Full-Text Search: Implement PostgreSQL full-text search:
   - Create tsvector column for search
   - Index: CREATE INDEX idx_scans_search ON scans USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', barcode_data || ' ' || COALESCE(product_name, '')))
   - Support partial matching
   - Rank results by relevance
2. Search Endpoint: Enhance GET /scans endpoint:
   - Add query parameter: ?search=text
   - Add filter parameters: dateFrom, dateTo, barcodeType, category, nutritionGrade, deviceType
   - Add sort parameter: sortBy, sortOrder
   - Return results with relevance score
3. Filter Implementation: Implement all filters:
   - Date range filter (startDate, endDate)
   - Barcode type filter (QR, EAN-13, UPC-A, etc.)
   - Product category filter (food, beverage, etc.)
   - Nutrition grade filter (A, B, C, D, E)
   - Device type filter (web, mobile-ios, mobile-android)
4. Sorting Options: Add sorting:
   - Date (newest first, oldest first)
