## Task 6.3: Web Scanner - History & Management

```
TASK: Create scan history interface with pagination, filtering, search, and management features.

SYSTEM CONTEXT: Central hub for viewing and managing all scans. Must handle large datasets efficiently with pagination and filtering.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. History Page: Create scan history page with table/card layout
2. Pagination: Implement pagination (20 scans per page)
3. Scan List: Display barcode data, type, timestamp, device
4. Scan Detail Modal: Click scan to view full details
5. Delete Functionality: Delete individual scans with confirmation
6. Bulk Actions: Select multiple scans for bulk delete
7. Search: Search by barcode data
8. Filters: Filter by barcode type, date range, device type
9. Sorting: Sort by date (newest/oldest)
10. Empty State: Show message when no scans
11. Loading States: Skeleton loaders during fetch
12. Error Handling: Display errors with retry option

CONSTRAINTS:
- Efficient rendering for large lists
- Fast search and filtering
