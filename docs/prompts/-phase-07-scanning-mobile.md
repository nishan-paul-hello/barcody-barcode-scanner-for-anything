   - syncStatus: 'idle' | 'syncing' | 'error'
   - queueCount: number
   - lastSyncTime: Date | null
   - errors: SyncError[]

## Task 7.3: Mobile Scanner - Scan Result UI

```
TASK: Create scan result and history screens with API integration and offline fallback.

SYSTEM CONTEXT: Display scan results and manage scan history. Must handle both online and offline scenarios gracefully.

REQUIREMENTS:
